Visualization of audio bird data using spectrograms.

`bird_species.ipynb` is used to calculate the spectrograms of each species from the citeU species.

The notebook `compare_format.ipynb` compare the effect of format (.wav, .mp3) on the spectrogram.

`compare_spectrograms.ipynb` visualize various example of audio extracts from citeU. Some tests on denoising using external tools have been tried.
