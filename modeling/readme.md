# Modeling

## First model from digit recognition

Participants: Patrick

Apply CNN model for digit recognition (audio) to bird datasets.

## First screening

Participants: Florent

Develop a model to reduce labeling time by pre-selecting part of the audio to use for labeling.

The model would have a high False Positive rate (the model thinks that there is bird sound but it's wrong). It would be trained on external datasets.

This first model could be either the model from digit recognition or from Hadrien's replication of Cakir et al. paper (cf. notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XBNdn98z89HpH2hCqi-bk_fDEQf1SgGA)).

## Model assessment

Participants: Camille

To gain more insights from success and failure it can useful to monitor what our models are doing (cf. [blog post from Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/)).
